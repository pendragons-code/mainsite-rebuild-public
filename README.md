# Rebuild-MainSite:
This is a rebuild of my personal site. This rebuild has quite a lot of configurations removed, meaning that you are expected to come up with some of your own things like api keys and more!

# How to run:
```
git clone https://github.com/pendragons-code/mainsite-rebuild-public
cd mainsite-rebuild-public
npm i
npm run start
```

# first time set up:
- download this repository
- unzip and enter the directory
- copy the file `.env.example` and rename it (`.env.example copied`) to `.env.production`
- open the folder in visual studio code
- sign up for an api key for the thing
- put the api key inside the environment file
- run `npm run start`)

# environment file:
